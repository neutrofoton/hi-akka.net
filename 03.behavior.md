# The Actor’s Switchable Behavior
Actors intrinsically have the ability to change their behavior at runtime! What do we mean by behavior? An actor’s behavior is its ability to react differently to the received message, depending on the conditions.

When the actor starts, it has its own default behavior, which means that the function to be executed when the message is received is set up at that point. However, this function might change based on some conditions. For instance, if the client is not authorized to execute something, the actor can switch the behavior and deny any further execution.

There is no limit on how many behaviors an actor may have, and changing of behavior is handled by the function <code>Become()</code>. After we call <code>Become()</code>, the previous behavior is forgotten unless we use the <code>BecomeStacked()</code> function, which creates a stack of behaviors, so that the behavior can be reverted by using <code>UnbecomeStacked()</code>.
