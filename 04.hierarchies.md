# Actor Hierarchies

We’ve seen how to create the top-level actors by using the <code>ActorSystem</code> directly. In this chapter, we are going to see how to create the hierarchy of actors, which means: how an actor can create subactors and form a hierarchy.

When creating new actors from existing actors, we don’t use the <code>ActorSystem</code> as the entry point, but instead use the <code>ActorContext</code> object, which is part of the base actor’s implementation.

<code>ActorContext</code> (or just <code>Context</code>, as this is how the actor base library exposes it) exposes contextual information for the actor and the current message. It provides more information, such as: factory methods to create child actors (in the same way the ActorSystem does), lifecycle
monitoring, supervised children, and so on.
